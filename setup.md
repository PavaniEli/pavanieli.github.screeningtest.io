# Set up a new Knowledge tenant (production)

The process described in this section is only for tenants in production environment. If your tenant is based in a Development, QA, UAT, or other environment, the procedure is slightly different.

>Note: If your tenant is NOT in production, request a distribution link.

## Prerequisites

* Content **Premium** role with the **System Administrator (Full Control)** system-level permissions.
* Enable acess on the tenant. Contact Seismic Support to enable access.

## Procedure

1. Install the Seismic Knowledge application. See [Install an app](https://docs.seismic.com/bundle/seismic_platform_ent/page/install_an_app.html) article for the procedure to install. <br> Once access is enabled, all existing users and user groups from the Seismic tenant automatically sync with the Knowledge instance.
Syncing may take a few minutes. This includes adding a new user to Seismic and addition or removal of users from the user groups. Changes will appear in Knowledge shortly after the operation in Seismic and the application is installed.

2. Refresh the page. The Knowledge shortcut, which includes a lightbulb icon, appears in the main menu with a slight delay.

3. Select the shortcut to be redirected to Knowledge, which will open in a new tab in your browser.

## Result

Users can now search Knowledge FAQs and Guides directly using the main search in Seismic.
